#Guild Wars 2 Inventory Search

This is a web app for Guild Wars 2 players.

Looks up who's holding the item you're looking for.  Good for players with many characters who share account-bound items with each other but don't want to waste time loading each character in game.  Site has a text-based interface for speed.

GW2Shinies supplies the item names to the item IDs ANet responds with.

##Current Issues

- Can't search for exact match. For example if a user wanted to search for the Bo staff the short character length would cause gw2shinies to match about 4000 items.

##To Do

- Remove duplicate characters from results
- Have item names in results link to corresponding gw2shinies page
- Search through account bank and characters' equipped items.  Currently only searches through characters' bags.
